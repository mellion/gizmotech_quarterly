   This project is a data analysis and visualization project for a fictional company's quarterly financial analysis. The company is called Gizmotech. As a brand new company, Gizmotech had only made two sales to two customers at the time of analysis. Despite the limited data, the company was eager to gain insights from their first business quarter. This project demonstrates how even small datasets can present interesting and challenging scenarios that mirror real-world situations. 
   Utilizing a combination of basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL queries, we delve into the data to answer critical business questions and facilitate informed decision-making. PostgreSQL serves as the backbone for data storage and manipulation, while Power BI is employed for crafting compelling visualizations that shed light on key financial metrics.This repository follows the process of creating a database, populating the database records with values, cleaning data, joining data, and data visualization. PostgreSQL and PowerBI were used for this project.
   This repository serves as a testament to the power of integrating PostgreSQL and Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights, even with minimal data. It highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making for organizations of any size, as they strive to optimize their financial performance in the early stages of growth.
